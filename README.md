<h3>Prepare all your vegetables - rinse and drain.
Thinly slice your cabbage and lettuce; cut the tomatoes and cucumber into little cubes; grate the carrots or cut them into little cubes.
Add everything inside a bowl except the eggs and the cream, then cover it with a plastic wrap or tight-fitting lid and place it in the fridge for at least 1 hour.
Remove it from the refrigerator once you are ready to eat and mix it up. Arrange the boiled eggs over the salad. Serve with the classic Heinz salad dressing, or use the recipe above.
This salad will serve 5 people as a main meal and up to 8 or 10 as a side meal.</h3
<h2>Note</h2>
<h3>
Dressing tends to make lettuce limp. Therefore, it is advisable to mix the salad at the last possible moment before serving to keep the leaves crisp.
It is best to use ripe but hard tomatoes. Soft juicy tomatoes will get the salad wet.
It's best to serve this salad cold</h3>
